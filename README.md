# homebrew-cask-eid
Casks of electronic identity card software of various countries ([why](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/issues/8033)).

This is a continuation of the previous official Homebrew tap for eIDs, which is [no longer maintained](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/issues/59021).

# Usage

After you install Homebrew, run the following command:

```sh
$ brew tap jerr0328/cask-eid
```

You can now install the casks in this repo.

```sh
$ brew cask install eid-pt
```
